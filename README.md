# Login-Signup-Page
A simple login/signup system built with React. You only need your database URL, whether it's MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. I am using MongoDB Atlas because MongoDB works very smoothly with Node.js. The backend uses Express.js, a flexible web application framework for Node.js. For security, bcryptjs is used to hash and protect user passwords.
